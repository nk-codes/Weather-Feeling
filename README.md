Project Demo video is already in my git repo named as "Project-demo.mkv". Just open and download as raw. Thanks ðŸ“§


This project is on Weather Information :-
1) It collects data from open weather API which is free.
2) I have used  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in vscode to do this project.
3) And finally used Microsoft Azure's Web App to deploy my project.

About App :- 
This app will show the Weather report with attributes like wind speed, humidity,Temperature and description as well, along with appropriate background pictures related to the place.

AZURE service used :- WEB APP 


Explanation :- Azure Web Apps are Microsoft's offering to cloud to host web applications. It allows developers to focus on delivering business values rather than consuming time on Sever updates or OS patches. Interestingly, applications built on Java, PHP, Python or Node. js can also be deployed on web apps

OpenWeather API used as well :-


APIs are needed to bring applications together in order to perform a designed function built around sharing data and executing pre-defined processes. They work as the middle man, allowing developers to build new programmatic interactions between the various applications people and businesses use on a daily basis.

I have done following  steps to finally deployed my project using Azure "Web App" :-

1) First i logged in with my student id into Microsoft Azure using the helpful bot in Azure site.
2) then I clicked on + Create a resource and then Clicked on Web App to create a new Web App resource.
