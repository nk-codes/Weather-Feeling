This project is on Weather Information :-
1) It collects data from open weather API which is free.
2) I have used  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to do this project.
3) And finally used Microsoft Azure's Web App to deploy my project.



AZURE service used :- WEB APP
Explanation :- Azure Web Apps are Microsoft's offering to cloud to host web applications. It allows developers to focus on delivering business values rather than consuming time on Sever updates or OS patches. Interestingly, applications built on Java, PHP, Python or Node. js can also be deployed on web apps
