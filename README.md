This project is on Weather Information :-
1) It collects data from open weather API which is free.
2) I have used  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to do this project.
3) And finally used Microsoft Azure's Web App to deploy my project.



AZURE service used :- WEB APP
Explanation :- Azure Web Apps are Microsoft's offering to cloud to host web applications. It allows developers to focus on delivering business values rather than consuming time on Sever updates or OS patches. Interestingly, applications built on Java, PHP, Python or Node. js can also be deployed on web apps

I have done following  steps to finally deployed my project using Azure "Web App" :-

1) First i logged in with my student id into Microsoft Azure using the helpful bot in Azure site.
2) then I clicked on + Create a resource and then Clicked on Web App to create a new Web App resource.    

3) Then I named the resource group as "Weather-app" and  app service as "feelweather" ,Runtime Task as "ASP.NET V4.8" and done all default .

4) And I clicked on Review + create and finally Review all the details entered and then clicked on Create.
5) After clicking on create it will start deploying the Web App resource.
6) Once deployment is complete the portal will display:

7) Then go to the resource group in which the Web App was created and click on the created Web App.
8) Finally, I CLick on Deployment Center and filled the following details and save and starts the service.
